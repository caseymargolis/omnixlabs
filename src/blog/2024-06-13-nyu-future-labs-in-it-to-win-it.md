omniX has been selected to be part of the NYU Future Labs seed-to-Series A cohort and we could not be happier or prouder. But what does this new achievement mean for omniX’s leadership and co-founding team?

### **Part of a selected few**

[NYU Future Labs](https://engineering.nyu.edu/research-innovation/entrepreneurship/nyu-tandon-future-labs) is a network of business incubators and accelerators that support early-stage ventures in New York City. The Future Labs offer the businesses of tomorrow a network of innovation spaces and programs that support early-stage startups and acts in a venture catalyst role.

The New York tech entrepreneurial landscape is a vibrant one, and the selection process for the programs is never easy. Only high potential companies are accepted and omniX is one of only 9 companies to be [selected in this year’s cohort](https://medium.com/future-labs/meet-our-next-round-2019-cohort-3d56c154ef23).

This is big news for omniX! The program will propel omniX and accelerate the growth of what is currently a thriving business. With the help of NYU Future labs, the team will immerse itself with leaders and peers in the industry and ensure the success achieved so far is built on and accelerated.
