omniX Labs is excited to announce that we have joined the Google Cloud Partner Advantage Program, enabling Google Cloud customers to take advantage of the omniX platform for their computer vision and data analytics needs via the [Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Marketplace](https://cloud.google.com/marketplace/).

“omniX is analytics for the physical world, using existing cameras to give you a trusted set of eyes on your business without the need to integrate with legacy systems, and the admission to the Google Cloud Partner Advantage Program validates our expertise and dedication to this craft,” says Anoop Kanthan, Co-Founder and CTO of omniX Labs.

omniX uses deep learning and computer vision to leverage your existing cameras to capture data that businesses can monetize. It’s a noninvasive and quick way to get a pulse on operational KPI’s, inefficiencies, or to better personalize and predict the behavior of customers. Simply enable omniX to connect to your cameras and start getting real-time visibility via our dashboards or API.

Let’s take an example of a car wash location where omniX can give you three tiers of capability. The first is real-time visibility at your location; how many vehicles, tracking them as they move throughout the facility, how long are the queues, total visit duration, all helping you keep on top of your business even when you are not there.

The second tier analytics; using the data to better understand the location and take action or advantage of opportunities. Get notified if wait times are exceeding a threshold so that you can breakdown a lane. On the revenue side, omniX can tell you in real-time about multi-repeat customers that are in your pay-as-you-go lanes so your attendants can target them for an upsell resulting in better conversion rates.

Thirdly, we go deeper to help you predict the future. We take all the data omniX is able to see at your location and combine that with other reference data such as traffic, local events, weather, seasons, public holidays to predict what is going to occur, such as sales volume by hour for tomorrow. Now you can really get ahead and plan your staffing and supply needs from the lane level right through to the location, region, or entire company.
